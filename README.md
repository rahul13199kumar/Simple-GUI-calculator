# Description
Python offers multiple options for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task.

# Process

1. Importing the module – tkinter.

2. Create the main window (container).

3. Add any number of widgets to the main window.

4. Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.

Let’s create a GUI based simple calculator using Python Tkinter module, which can perform basic arithmatic operations addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*) and division(/).


# What is a Calculator?

For those who do not know, a calculator is basically a program on a computer that simulates the behavior of any hand-held calculator useful for performing Mathematical Calculations. It is a very basic device used in our every day lives. Now all the smartphones also have a Calculator application in them.

While creating any GUI Application there are mainly two steps:

The first step is to create a User Interface.

The second step is the most important one and in this, to add functionalities to the GUI

Now let's begin with creating a simple calculator app using Tkinter in Python which is used for basic arithmetic calculations.
